# Full stack code for Soundo app frontend and backend.

The app is still undergoing development so development servers for both have to be initialised to use. 

For frontend in React run the command yarn dev from within the lower soundo folder (ie soundo/soundo) and the app should become available on localhost:5173

For the backend, the Django virtual environment file env is in the first soundoback folder (soundo/soundoback), will activate on command source env/bin/activate. Manage.py is in lower soundoback folder (soundo/soundoback/soundoback), runserver command is python manage.py runserver
